Elliptic curve arithmetic in Sagemath

Elliptic curves are a fascinating area of mathematics that have found numerous applications in modern cryptography, particularly in the field of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). ECC has gained popularity due to its ability to provide the same level of security as traditional cryptographic methods, such as RSA, but with smaller key sizes. This results in faster computations and reduced storage requirements, making ECC an attractive choice for securing communications in resource-constrained environments.

In this blog post, we aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to elliptic curve arithmetic and its applications in cryptography. We will explore the basics of elliptic curves, delve into the arithmetic operations performed on them, and demonstrate how to work with elliptic curves using the powerful SageMath software. By the end of this post, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of elliptic curve arithmetic and be well-equipped to explore more advanced topics in ECC.
